##This repository contains two Python programs showcasing file manipulation and error handling techniques.

###1. File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️
A program designed to read the contents of a file (Details.txt) and create a modified version of it (Details_modified.txt).

-Reads the input file and prints its contents.
-Writes the data to a new file while ensuring the output matches the input file's structure.
-Demonstrates basic file I/O operations in Python.

###Error Handling Lab 🧪
A program that asks the user for a filename and gracefully handles errors if the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read.

-Uses a try-except-finally block for robust error handling.
-Ensures the file is closed properly in all scenarios.
